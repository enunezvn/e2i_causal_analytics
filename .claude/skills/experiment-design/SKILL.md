# Experiment Design Skills

This category contains procedural knowledge for designing rigorous experiments in pharmaceutical commercial contexts.

## Skills in this Category

### validity-threats.md
**Purpose**: 6-threat taxonomy for experiment design validation
**Triggers**: validity threats, experiment validation, internal validity, external validity
**Use When**: Assessing experimental designs for potential biases and threats

### power-analysis.md
**Purpose**: Sample size calculation and power analysis procedures
**Triggers**: sample size, power analysis, statistical power, minimum detectable effect
**Use When**: Determining required sample sizes for experiments

## Common Patterns

### Pre-Experiment Checklist
1. Define primary outcome and effect size of interest
2. Calculate required sample size (power-analysis.md)
3. Assess validity threats (validity-threats.md)
4. Design mitigations for identified threats
5. Document assumptions and limitations

### Integration with Other Categories
- **causal-inference**: Use validity assessment before causal estimation
- **pharma-commercial**: Apply brand-specific confounders to threat assessment
- **gap-analysis**: Use ROI estimation to justify experiment investment
