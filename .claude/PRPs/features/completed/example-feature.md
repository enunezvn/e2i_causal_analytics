# Feature: Example Feature Implementation

**Status**: Completed
**Date Completed**: 2025-12-15
**Implemented By**: Claude Code Framework

## Overview

This is an example PRP (Product Requirements Plan) showing how to document completed features. Use this as a template for tracking your own features.

## User Story

As a developer
I want to see an example of a completed feature documentation
So that I can document my own features effectively

## Problem Statement

Teams need a consistent way to document completed features for:
- Knowledge transfer
- Onboarding new team members
- Historical reference
- Learning from past implementations

## Solution Implemented

Created a template PRP document demonstrating:
- Feature metadata and status tracking
- Implementation approach documentation
- Lessons learned capture
- Code references and patterns used

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

#### Files Created
- `.claude/PRPs/features/completed/example-feature.md` - This documentation

#### Files Modified
- None (example only)

### Key Components

1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Clear user story format
   - Problem and solution statements
   - Implementation details
   - Lessons learned

2. **Metadata Tracking**
   - Completion date
   - Status
   - Implementer

## Patterns and Techniques Used

### Documentation Pattern
```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

**Status**: [Active/Completed/Archived]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## User Story
As a [type of user]
I want [goal]
So that [benefit]

## Implementation Details
[Details here]

## Lessons Learned
[Insights here]
```

### Code Organization
- Keep related functionality together
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Include tests with implementation

## Validation Performed

- [x] Code review completed
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Deployed successfully

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Clear Planning**: Having a detailed plan made implementation straightforward
2. **Test-Driven**: Writing tests first caught issues early
3. **Code Review**: Peer review improved code quality

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Earlier Validation**: Run validation more frequently during development
2. **Better Estimates**: Initial time estimate was optimistic
3. **More Examples**: Could have included more code examples

### Key Insights
- Plan thoroughly before implementing
- Validate continuously, not just at the end
- Document as you go, not after the fact
- Examples are invaluable for future reference

## Related Features

## Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~100
- **Tests Added**: 5
- **Coverage**: 100%
- **Time Invested**: 2 hours
- **Bugs Found**: 0

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add more real-world examples
- Include screenshots or diagrams
- Add links to commits/PRs
- Include performance metrics

## Notes

This example demonstrates best practices for documenting completed features. Adapt this template to your project's needs:

- Add sections relevant to your domain
- Include project-specific metrics
- Reference your team's standards
- Keep it concise but comprehensive
