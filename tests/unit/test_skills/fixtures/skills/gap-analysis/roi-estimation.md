# ROI Estimation Procedures

Standard procedures for estimating ROI and sizing opportunities in pharma commercial analytics.

## Revenue Multipliers

### Standard Revenue Multipliers

Per-prescription revenue benchmarks by brand:

| Brand | TRx Revenue | NRx Revenue |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Kisqali | $500 per TRx | $2,500 per NRx |
| Fabhalta | $800 per TRx | $4,000 per NRx |
| Remibrutinib | $350 per TRx | $1,750 per NRx |

### Lifetime Value Estimation

Patient lifetime value = NRx * Duration of therapy * Per-fill revenue

## Cost to Close

### Cost-to-Close Framework

Total Cost to Close = Direct costs + Indirect costs + Opportunity costs

### Direct Cost Components

- Sales rep FTE allocation
- Marketing materials
- Speaker programs
- Digital engagement

### Indirect Costs

- Training and enablement
- Analytics and reporting
- Technology platform costs

## ROI Calculation

### Formula

ROI = (Revenue Impact - Cost to Close) / Cost to Close

### ROI Interpretation Thresholds

| ROI | Rating |
|-----|--------|
| > 3.0 | Excellent - pursue aggressively |
| 2.0 - 3.0 | Strong - standard priority |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Moderate - selective pursuit |
| < 1.0 | Low - reconsider approach |

## Opportunity Categorization

### Quick Win

- High ROI (> 3.0)
- Low cost to close
- Short payback period (< 3 months)

### Strategic Bet

- Moderate ROI (1.5 - 3.0)
- Higher investment required
- Longer payback period (6-12 months)
- Strategic alignment value

### Long-term Investment

- Lower immediate ROI
- Significant capability building
- Payback period > 12 months

## Payback Period

### Calculation

Payback Period (months) = Cost to Close / Monthly Revenue Impact

### Benchmarks

- Promotional programs: 2-4 months typical payback
- Digital initiatives: 3-6 months typical payback
- New channel development: 6-12 months typical payback

## Brand-Specific Multipliers

### Kisqali

- Oncology premium pricing
- Longer duration of therapy
- Higher switching costs

### Fabhalta

- Rare disease premium
- Small patient population
- High per-patient value

### Remibrutinib

- Large addressable market (CSU)
- Competitive pricing dynamics
- Volume-driven revenue model
