# Gap Analysis Skills

This category contains procedural knowledge for identifying and quantifying business opportunities in pharmaceutical commercial contexts.

## Skills in this Category

### roi-estimation.md
**Purpose**: Revenue impact and cost-to-close calculation methodology
**Triggers**: ROI calculation, revenue impact, cost to close, opportunity sizing
**Use When**: Quantifying the value of closing identified performance gaps

## Common Patterns

### Gap Analysis Workflow
1. Identify gap (current vs target/benchmark/potential)
2. Classify gap type (strategic, competitive, operational)
3. Calculate revenue impact (roi-estimation.md)
4. Estimate cost to close
5. Compute ROI and payback period
6. Categorize opportunity (quick win, strategic bet, optimization)

### Integration with Other Categories
- **pharma-commercial**: Use KPI definitions for gap metrics
- **causal-inference**: Validate causal assumptions before ROI estimation
- **experiment-design**: Design experiments to validate gap-closing interventions

## Gap Types

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| vs_target | Current vs strategic target | Market share 32% vs target 35% |
| vs_benchmark | Current vs peer/competitor | Conversion 8% vs industry 12% |
| vs_potential | Current vs addressable max | Reach 60% vs potential 85% |
| vs_prior | Current vs previous period | TRx down 5% YoY |
